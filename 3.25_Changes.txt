Quake II v3.25

Author: Michael Ole Olsen <gnu@gmx.net> and more*


Changes:

- black console background
- config.cfg write support , was really annoying it didn't save config.cfg
- critical bugfix for dedicated server which could reveal rcon password
- no demo sequels at startup
- no joystick support
- vsync bug fixed (gl_swapinterval that would force you to i.e. 59fps, now you got 1000fps!)
- stufftext filter

For a simpler quake2.exe without any fuzz, just the genuine quake2 feel you always wanted!

No extra stuff, just the newest base quake2 that is stable, all extra stuff removed.
