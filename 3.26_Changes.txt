Quake II v3.26

Author: Michael Ole Olsen <gnu@gmx.net> and more

3.26~rc2 Changes:
- fixed sound volume too high in quake2 on lowest volume 
  (was annoying for mp3 listening, quake2 sound was too loud in lowest setting)

  new icons in .exe file

  disabled HTTP error reporting in console for simplicity

3.26-rc1 Changes:
- added libcurl.dll so curl HTTP always works

3.26 Changes:
- http download support works now fully


3.25 Changes:
- black console background
- config.cfg write support , was really annoying it didn't save config.cfg
- critical bugfix for dedicated server which could reveal rcon password
- no demo sequels at startup
- no joystick support
- vsync bug fixed (gl_swapinterval that would force you to i.e. 59fps, now you got 1000fps!)
  toggle vsync off in video menu to get many fps!!
- stufftext filter
- cleanup of console and menus
  no unneeded items, no errors anymore, just how you want quake2 to be, simple and clean!
- the perfect quake2 icon! - high res,transparent - to replace the old pixelated one


For a simpler quake2.exe without any fuzz, just the genuine quake2 feel you always wanted!

No extra stuff, just the newest base quake2 that is stable, all extra stuff removed.
