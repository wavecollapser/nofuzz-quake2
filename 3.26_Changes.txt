Quake II v3.26

Author: Michael Ole Olsen <gnu@gmx.net> and more*

3.26 Changes:
- http download support works now (skins,sounds,maps etc.)


3.25 Changes:

- black console background
- config.cfg write support , was really annoying it didn't save config.cfg
- critical bugfix for dedicated server which could reveal rcon password
- no demo sequels at startup
- no joystick support
- vsync bug fixed (gl_swapinterval that would force you to i.e. 59fps, now you got 1000fps!)
  toggle vsync off in video menu to get many fps!!
- stufftext filter
- cleanup of console and menus
  no unneeded items, no errors anymore, just how you want quake2 to be, simple and clean!
- the perfect quake2 icon! - high res,transparent - to replace the old pixelated one


For a simpler quake2.exe without any fuzz, just the genuine quake2 feel you always wanted!

No extra stuff, just the newest base quake2 that is stable, all extra stuff removed.
